# Gender Bias Detection using Sentiment Analysis
## Problem Statement:
As is well known, there are many vulnarable
remarks made by women via social media or at work
where it is doubtful that random tweets will contain the sexiest content
comments about women.
It has been urged to use machine learning to detect gender bias using tweets from Twitter in light of comments like these that make derogatory statements about working women.
## Methodology:
With input from tweets, Sentimental Analysis is employed as the main principle and is carried out using machine learning to ensure security.
This emotive examination of tweets raises public awareness and permits women to publicly express their feelings. We have relied heavily on Twitter to further our research and go through the viewpoints of others around us.
## Modules Used:
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Scikit-learn
* Spacy
* nltk

## Biasfinder: Generating metamorphic tests to detect bias in sentiment analysis systems
## Data Extraction:
Web scraping of Twitter data has been used to collect data from social networking services (SNS). The SNSCRAPE scraping utility retrieves data from hashtags without the need to access Twitter's API or obtain developer account permission.
